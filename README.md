# FractalTree
This Java program is not a true fractal. It simulates the growth of a tree (not the data structure). The code structure is recursive in nature like that of a fractal. Use of randomness in the algorithm causes the creation of a unique tree each time the program is run. Watch it long enough and the leaves will turn color and fall off.
